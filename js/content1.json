		"mech": "fed up with how the laser cutter lineup turns rapid prototyping into slightly less rapid prototyping, you decide to take matters into your own hands. welcome to the era of your hardboard box-cutting business. your work is a bit slower than the laser cutter, for sure, and a little more jagged, but no one knows press fits like you do.",
		"elec": "charging $5 per hand-soldered cable may sound a little steep, but hey, it's worth the artistry and avoidance of solder fumes. you also happen to be great at knowing exactly when right angle and non-right angle headers should be used. business gets a little slow outside of july, but you're hopeful it'll pick up again next year.",
		"soft": "forget qrds, peak detectors, and h-bridges: you tell your robot which way to go by telepathy. it may not quite be an autonomous robot anymore, but how will anyone know? it's a whole new level of connection. just watch out for time trials...",
		"acad": "it's a tricky job, but you're happy to have been hired as a part-time power on/off switcher for enph 257. good data is hard to come by, but so is the quality of your sense of timing.",
		"mech_elec": "the market is a little niche, your skillset is very specific, and you're not sure if it's legal to be running a tattoo studio in the lab, but people love it! your fanbase keeps you going.",
		"elec_soft": "power supply was off? been there. nothing was connected to signal 1? been there. the usb cable wasn't connected to the tinah? been there. it feels good to finally be paid for your expertise.",
		"mech_soft": "it's a struggle when you just want to test that servo but the tinah isn't cooperating. it turns out that there's a market for human tinahs! you're great at reading code and acting out motions. if the delay was put in the wrong place, you make sure to actually delay(1000); between every angle of rotation! it's a tough job, but it sure is rewarding.",
		"mech_elec_soft": "you know your robot so well that you can act just like it! you know that it can sometimes be hard to figure out how the old 253 robots work just by looking at them. you go above and beyond by coming into the lab to pretend to be your robot. it's arguably easier to just power up the robot, but hey, can it explain in words how it's working? that's how you stand out."
